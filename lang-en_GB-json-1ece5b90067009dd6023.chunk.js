It was green, heavily marketed, and just nutritious enough to keep the people of Terra well enough to purchase more.":"","Questionable nutrition aside, the largest problem with Grisal was that it was not sustainable. The production of Grisal was expensive and disruptive to the natural ecosystems of Terra, as it involved the destruction of the planet\\\\\'s Dark Elm trees.":"","To keep our planet alive, we must explore sustainable food production. This involves the production of food that conserves our natural resources, while remain affordable and accessible to our people.":"","Waste":"","The production of Green Grisal involved burning Terra\\\\\'s lush Dark Elm trees. While this process seemed natural and safe to the people at first, the dangers became apparent before long.":"","Gloom, a thick smog, rose from the flames of the Dark Elm. It enveloped the planet, blocking the Great Sun\\\\\'s rays.":"","Murk, a sludge, oozed from the flames of the Dark Elm. It was funnelled to the seas until it took a life of its own.":"","What the people of Terra learned too late was the lesson of Restoration. As the Dark Elms fell, Light Elms could have been planted in their place.":"","Light Elms were a sister tree to the Dark Elm that produced the Gaia Apple. Gaia Apples were golden in shine and were far more nutritous. Their consumption was sustainable and did not produce Gloom nor Murk.":"","If the people of Terra restored what they destroyed via the planting of Light Elms, they could have saved their world while producing less waste and creating a sustainable food source.":"","Create Gloomsite":"","#terras-legacy":"","Do you have pictures Gloomsites around the world to share with our community?
